        <h3>Win Rate Prediction for High Elo Ranked Games</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="des">
        <p class="content">
          Just tell us your plan for your next high elo ranked games (Challenger, GrandMaster, Master),
          such as whether you want to have first blood,
          total gold you want to gain, number of kills, and etc.
          We will predict your probability of winning the
          game with 95% accuracy based on historical data. <br><br>
          Please note that it's a common sense that you need to
          destory your opponent's base to win a game, so some
          winning elements such as number of tower kills, number
          of inhibitor kills, and quantity of object damage dealt
          are not included in our prediction model. They are vital
          to the victory of a game, so it's unnecessary to analyze them. <br><br>
